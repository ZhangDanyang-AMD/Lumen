# Welcome to Lumen

**Lumen** is a lightweight, AMD-native quantized training framework for large language models.

Lumen manages the **quantized training lifecycle** — the vertical path a low-precision tensor takes through forward, backward, optimizer, and communication — and delegates everything else (optimizer, data loading, distributed orchestration) to the training backend.

Lumen is **non-invasive** with:

- **One-line enablement** — `quant.enable(model)` patches an existing model for quantized training without changing model code or checkpoint format.
- **Unified `QuantConfig`** — A single configuration object governs format, scaling strategy, amax algorithm, activation/gradient quantization, and all precision-related knobs.
- **Backend-agnostic** — The same quantization semantics work across **FSDP** and **Megatron-LM** backends, so switching parallelism strategies does not require re-engineering precision paths.

Lumen is **fast** with:

- **FP8 formats** — FP8 E4M3, E5M2, MXFP8, and Hybrid precision with up to **2× peak FLOPS** over BF16 on AMD Instinct MI300X.
- **[AITER kernels](https://github.com/ROCm/aiter)** — High-performance fused operators for attention, GEMM, normalization, RoPE, MoE, MLP, cross-entropy, and quantization with ASM → CK → Triton fallback.
- **[MORI communication](https://github.com/ROCm/mori)** — Native RDMA + GPU communication with FP8 parameter all-gather (~2× bandwidth saving) and compute–communication overlap.
