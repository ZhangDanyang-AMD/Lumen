# TRL + Lumen FSDP/FSDP2 Execution Checklist

## Goal

Bring up `GRPO`-first distributed RL training in `TRL` using Lumen-patched HuggingFace models under `FSDP1` and `FSDP2`, while keeping rollout generation on plain HuggingFace Transformers in the first milestone.

All file paths below are target layout. If they do not exist yet, create them as part of the task.

## Fixed Decisions

- [ ] Lock the first online RL algorithm to `GRPO`
- [ ] Lock rollout generation to plain HuggingFace Transformers for v1
- [ ] Lock the training backend to `FSDP1` and `FSDP2`
- [ ] Lock the first supported model family to LLaMA-class HuggingFace checkpoints
- [ ] Keep `DeepSpeed`, `vLLM`, `PPO` value-head support, Megatron, and non-LLaMA models out of scope for v1

## Pre-Flight

- [ ] Confirm the target machine has 2 usable GPUs for distributed smoke validation
- [ ] Confirm the implementation will reuse `lumen.models.fsdp` helpers rather than cloning LoRA / FP8 / checkpoint logic
- [ ] Confirm `examples/rl/trl/requirements.txt` will be the source of truth for the pinned `trl` / `transformers` / `accelerate` / `datasets` stack
- [ ] Confirm the team understands the ownership risk: the pinned `TRL + Accelerate + FSDP` stack may or may not accept a pre-built model

## Task 1: Package Boundary and Argument Contract

Files:

- `lumen/rl/__init__.py`
- `lumen/rl/trl/__init__.py`
- `lumen/rl/trl/args.py`
- `tests/rl/trl/test_args.py`

Checklist:

- [ ] Write the failing contract tests in `tests/rl/trl/test_args.py`
- [ ] Add `TrlLumenArgs`
- [ ] Add `build_accelerate_config_path(...)`
- [ ] Add `build_grpo_config_kwargs(...)`
- [ ] Keep `lumen/rl/trl/args.py` pure: do not import `torch`, `transformers`, or `trl`
- [ ] Re-export the stable entrypoints from `lumen/rl/trl/__init__.py`
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/rl/trl/test_args.py -v`
- [ ] Mark this task done only after the contract tests pass

## Task 2: HuggingFace Model Builders with Lumen Patching

Files:

- `lumen/rl/trl/modeling.py`
- `tests/rl/trl/test_modeling.py`

Checklist:

- [ ] Write the failing lifecycle tests for actor construction
- [ ] Add `build_actor_model(args)`
- [ ] Add `build_reference_model(args)`
- [ ] Add `build_reward_model(args)`
- [ ] Ensure actor ordering is `gradient_checkpointing -> LoRA -> FP8`
- [ ] Ensure only the actor gets LoRA in v1
- [ ] Ensure reference and reward builders can apply FP8 without LoRA
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/rl/trl/test_modeling.py -v`
- [ ] Mark this task done only after all model lifecycle tests pass

## Task 3: Synthetic Warmup and FP8 Reset

Files:

- `lumen/rl/trl/warmup.py`
- `tests/rl/trl/test_warmup.py`

Checklist:

- [ ] Write the failing warmup tests
- [ ] Add `maybe_run_synthetic_warmup(model, args, *, device)`
- [ ] Use a zero-learning-rate optimizer so warmup exercises backward and optimizer state paths without meaningful weight drift
- [ ] Reset FP8 state after the warmup loop completes
- [ ] Keep distributed logic out of this helper; device selection belongs in the runner
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/rl/trl/test_warmup.py -v`
- [ ] Mark this task done only after warmup tests pass

## Task 4: GRPO Runner and Launch Entry Points

Files:

- `lumen/rl/trl/runner.py`
- `examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.py`
- `examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.sh`
- `examples/rl/trl/requirements.txt`
- `examples/rl/trl/accelerate/fsdp1.yaml`
- `examples/rl/trl/accelerate/fsdp2.yaml`
- `tests/rl/trl/test_runner_smoke.py`

Checklist:

- [ ] Write the failing runner wiring test
- [ ] Add a pinned dependency stack to `examples/rl/trl/requirements.txt`
- [ ] Add `fsdp1.yaml` and `fsdp2.yaml`
- [ ] Add `run_grpo(args, *, reward_fn)` to the runner
- [ ] Add the `accelerate launch` entrypoint in `examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.py`
- [ ] Add the canonical shell launcher in `examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.sh`
- [ ] Verify whether the pinned `TRL + Accelerate + FSDP` stack accepts a pre-built model
- [ ] If the pinned stack rejects a pre-built model, switch to a trainer-owned lazy-init path before proceeding
- [ ] Keep the ownership choice explicit in runner comments so future upgrades know which mode is in use
- [ ] Run `pytest tests/rl/trl/test_runner_smoke.py -v`
- [ ] Mark this task done only after the runner wiring test passes

## Task 5: Distributed Smoke and Output Validation

Files:

- `tests/rl/trl/test_runner_smoke.py`
- `examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.sh`

Checklist:

- [ ] Add an opt-in slow subprocess-based distributed smoke test
- [ ] Document the FSDP1 launcher command: `bash examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.sh 1`
- [ ] Document the FSDP2 launcher command: `bash examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.sh 2`
- [ ] Run the fast suite: `pytest tests/rl/trl/test_args.py tests/rl/trl/test_modeling.py tests/rl/trl/test_warmup.py tests/rl/trl/test_runner_smoke.py -v`
- [ ] Run the opt-in slow suite on a 2-GPU machine: `LUMEN_RUN_SLOW_RL_TESTS=1 pytest tests/rl/trl/test_runner_smoke.py -v`
- [ ] Run the example launcher directly: `bash examples/rl/trl/run_grpo_fsdp.sh 1`
- [ ] Confirm trainer startup succeeds under the pinned stack
- [ ] Confirm the run reaches the expected small-step smoke target
- [ ] Confirm the output directory contains trainer state and checkpoint artifacts
- [ ] If FSDP wrapping or trainer init fails because of the model ownership mode, go back to Task 4 and change the runner before retrying this task

## Exit Gate

- [ ] `lumen/rl/trl/` exists and imports cleanly
- [ ] The `GRPO` runner builds a Lumen-patched HuggingFace actor model
- [ ] Synthetic warmup plus `reset_fp8_state()` runs before real RL training
- [ ] `FSDP1` and `FSDP2` launch configs both exist
- [ ] Fast unit tests pass
- [ ] 2-GPU smoke validation passes
- [ ] No NaN / Inf is observed during the smoke run
- [ ] Checkpoint and resume behavior is understood for the pinned stack

## Deferred Until Post-v1

- `vLLM` generation support
- `PPO` value-head support
- multi-turn environment integration
- non-LLaMA model families
- DeepSpeed support
