"""aiter's FlyDSL implicit-GEMM convolution for the VAE patches (``lumen_vae_conv.py``).

:func:`conv` has ``F.conv2d`` / ``F.conv3d`` semantics. It runs the kernel where
the kernel applies -- BF16, on the GPU, no gradient needed (it is forward-only)
-- and torch everywhere else, so an FP32 VAE or a caller that needs a backward
still gets the right answer.

The kernel is ``aiter.ops.flydsl.flydsl_conv_implicit`` (ROCm/aiter#5370). It
selects launch tiles from per-model tuned tables
(``aiter/configs/model_configs/*_bf16_tuned_conv3d.csv``), including the 96- and
192-wide N tiles that VAE channel counts of 96/192/384 fill exactly and a
power-of-two tile ladder leaves a quarter empty.

Two things an aiter install older than that PR gets wrong once its files are
added, and which this module handles so the installed files can stay as
shipped. With an aiter that includes the PR, both steps find what they need and
do nothing:

* **The tuned table path.** The PR adds ``AITER_CONFIGS.AITER_CONFIG_CONV3D_BF16_FILE``
  in ``aiter/jit/core.py``. Without it the kernel's table loader catches the
  ``AttributeError`` and returns an empty table, so every call silently takes
  the heuristic tile. :func:`_install_config_property` supplies the same
  property, resolved the same way (``AITER_CONFIG_CONV3D_BF16`` if set, else the
  canonical CSV merged with every ``model_configs/*bf16_tuned_conv3d*.csv``).
* **The package import.** An older ``aiter/ops/flydsl/__init__.py`` eagerly
  imports GEMM/MoE kernels written against a flydsl that still has
  ``flydsl.compiler.protocol.fly_values``, which the flydsl this kernel needs
  (>= 0.3, for ``flydsl.expr.struct``) no longer has. The package then cannot
  be imported at all, although nothing the convolution uses is involved.
  :func:`import_flydsl_module` tries the normal import first, and only if that
  fails loads the convolution modules underneath a bare package object, which
  it removes again afterwards: any other ``import aiter.ops.flydsl`` fails
  exactly as it did before, so the rest of aiter is left as the process had it.

:func:`tuned_lookup_stats` counts how each call was resolved -- exact tuned row,
a row borrowed from the same layer at a nearby resolution, or the heuristic --
because a table that is present but never matched looks identical to one that
works everywhere except in the step time.
