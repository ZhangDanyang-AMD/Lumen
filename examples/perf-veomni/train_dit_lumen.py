"""VeOmni DiT training entry point with Lumen op replacement.

Mirrors tasks/train_dit.py, but wraps DiTTrainer._build_model so Lumen patches
the module tree after it is built and before FSDP2 wraps it. VeOmni source is
left untouched -- train.sh forwards its arguments to torchrun, so this file can
stand in for the task script.

Which ops get replaced is set by LUMEN_PATCH (comma-separated):

    linear   846 nn.Linear.forward -> lumen dispatch_gemm, with Lumen's own
             autograd.Function. BF16 in, BF16 out, so numerics should be
             unchanged.
    vae_conv 52 QwenImageCausalConv3d.forward in the frozen VAE -> Lumen's
             conv op on aiter's FlyDSL kernel. See lumen_vae_conv.py for why
             the T=1 causal rewrite is exact and which layers are
             deliberately left on torch. This is
             the only patch that touches the condition model rather than the
             DiT, and the one the FlyDSL kernel was written for: the VAE is
             frozen and runs under no_grad, which matches the kernel's
             forward-only limit.
    vae_conv_video
             vae_conv plus the shapes the T=1 rewrite cannot take. On a clip
             the T=1 identity holds only for the encoder's first chunk -- every
             later chunk carries a feature cache, so its leading frames are
             real data rather than zeros. This mode also rebinds the kernel
             underneath the module's own causal padding, which covers those,
             and takes the plain 2-D resamplers, which are faster through Lumen
             at video resolutions and slower at 256^2. Use it for Wan, LTX-2,
             MiniMax-H3; on Qwen-Image it adds nothing, because there every call
             is already reducible.
    conv_pad_in_kernel
             Modifier for vae_conv_video. The causal convolutions' stock forward
             F.pads a full copy of every input before a padding=0 convolution;
             this hands the (symmetric) spatial padding to the kernel instead,
             which applies it with range masks and no copy, and materialises
             only the temporal zeros the feature cache does not cover. See
             lumen_vae_conv._bind_causal_pad_in_kernel.
    vae_bf16 Cast the frozen VAE to BF16. NOT a Lumen patch and not free --
             it changes what the trainer computes. It is here because
             VeOmni loads this VAE in FP32
             (modeling_qwen_image_condition.py:83, hardcoded) while the FlyDSL
             kernel is BF16-only, so without it `vae_conv` silently runs on
             torch and no FlyDSL code executes at all. Combine the two to
             measure the kernel; use it alone to separate the cost of the dtype
             change from the benefit of the kernel.
    norm     NOT SAFE on this model, and refused below. The DiT's 241
             LayerNorms are elementwise_affine=False (AdaLayerNorm supplies
             scale/shift from a separate Linear). Lumen's _patch_norms swaps in
             LumenLayerNorm, which creates affine weights by default, adding 482
             trainable tensors the optimizer and FSDP2 never accounted for.

The rest are veomni_patches/ entries, applied before the trainer builds
anything (see that package for what each one does and how it was measured):

    sdpa_efficient    SDPA flash backend off, so the attention backward is
                      aiter's fused fmha_bwd. Makes the run nondeterministic.
    attn_triton_fwd   DiT attention forward on aiter's Triton kernel, backward
                      on the efficient one. Requires sdpa_efficient.
    rmsnorm_fuse      diffusers RMSNorm forward fused by torch.compile. Only
                      Qwen-Image's DiT uses diffusers' RMSNorm; Wan's is
                      torch.nn.RMSNorm, already one fused kernel.
    local_adamw       Fused AdamW on FSDP2 local shards. Bit-identical.
    qwen_offline_fix  VeOmni 573848a defect: Qwen-Image offline_training
                      crashes on its first step without it.

vae_conv* run aiter's FlyDSL convolution (ROCm/aiter#5370) with its tuned
tables (veomni_patches/aiter_conv.py); the run refuses to start if it is
unavailable. Only `linear` imports the Lumen library.

The DiT is constructed under init_device=meta. The linear patch only rebinds
`forward` and never touches weights, so it is safe there. vae_conv reads
`weight[:, :, -1]` at patch time, which needs real values -- fine because the
condition model is loaded with weights and moved to the device for
online_training, never meta-initialised (dit_trainer.py:320).

    LUMEN_PATCH=vae_conv bash train.sh $EXAMPLE_DIR/train_dit_lumen.py <cfg> ...

LUMEN_TIME_VAE=1 additionally times vae.encode and reports its share of the
trainer's wall clock. It synchronises on every call, so it is for a separate
diagnostic run, not for a run whose step time will be quoted.

LUMEN_BATCH_HASH=1 prints an MD5 of every input the condition model's
get_condition / process_condition receive, per rank and call, so two
data-loading configurations can be shown to feed identical bytes in identical
order (compare_batch_hash.py) -- the only way to show it on Wan, whose loss does
not reproduce run to run. It copies every sample to the host; never time it.

Use run_10steps.sh or run_wan_10steps.sh rather than invoking this directly;
they set every variable the comparison needs to hold fixed.
