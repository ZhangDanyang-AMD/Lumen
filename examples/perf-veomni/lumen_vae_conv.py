"""Route a diffusers VAE's convolutions through aiter's FlyDSL kernel (``veomni_patches.aiter_conv``).

Used by ``train_dit_lumen.py`` (LUMEN_PATCH=vae_conv / vae_conv_video),
``verify_aiter_conv.py``, which checks it against the unpatched model, and
``tune_conv3d.py``.

Why this is safe here
---------------------
``DiTTrainer._freeze_model_module`` calls ``condition_model.requires_grad_(False)``
and the task is ``online_training``, so the VAE runs forward-only inside
``@torch.no_grad()``. FlyDSL has no dgrad/wgrad, and that is exactly the
constraint this workload already satisfies.

Two rewrites, because images and video are different problems
-------------------------------------------------------------
``QwenImageCausalConv3d`` and ``WanCausalConv3d`` are the same module written
twice: both subclass ``nn.Conv3d``, pad time asymmetrically (``kT-1`` zero frames
in front, none behind, minus whatever an inference feature cache supplies), and
then convolve with ``padding=0``.

**T == 1 and no feature cache** -- an image, or a video VAE's first chunk. Every
kernel slice but the last multiplies zeros, so

    conv3d(pad(x), w)  ==  conv2d(x, w[:, :, -1])

exactly -- not approximately. Symmetric ``padding=1`` on a 3-D convolution would
*not* be causal and would give a different answer. This is where most of the
Qwen-Image win comes from: torch's conv3d is poor on a degenerate time axis, and
leaving conv3d is worth more than the kernel swap is (2.27x versus 1.13x at
256^2).

**Everything else** -- a real clip, or a T == 1 chunk whose leading frames come
from the feature cache rather than from zeros. No 2-D identity exists: the
cached frames are real data, so dropping the other kernel slices would change
the result. Here the module's own padding is left exactly as it is and only the
convolution underneath it is replaced, with the FlyDSL ``conv3d`` on the unmodified
5-D filter. ``nn.Conv3d.forward`` is a single call to
``self._conv_forward(input, self.weight, self.bias)``, so rebinding
``_conv_forward`` swaps the kernel and nothing else -- the causal padding and the
cache handling are reused verbatim instead of being reimplemented here, which is
the part that would be easy to get wrong.

The second rewrite is what ``video=True`` adds, and it is where a video VAE's
time goes: at 17 frames of 480x832, 83.3% of one Wan encode's convolution time
is on T>1 or feature-cache calls, and FlyDSL is 1.60x torch on them.

What is left on torch, and why
------------------------------
Pointwise convolutions -- ``conv_shortcut``, ``quant_conv``, and Wan's
``time_conv`` (3x1x1, so its *spatial* kernel is 1) -- are launch-bound and
measure 0.88-1.05x through FlyDSL. ``min_spatial_kernel`` skips them.

The plain ``nn.Conv2d`` spatial resamplers are resolution-dependent and so are
tied to ``video``: 0.88x at Qwen-Image's 256^2, but 1.19-1.86x on Wan's
481x833, where they are 4.7% of convolution time. Off for images, on for video.
