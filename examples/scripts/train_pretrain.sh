# Megatron pretrain body for the precision-comparison benchmark, shared by
# every model and by the docker and native launchers.
#
# One body on purpose. The point of the benchmark is to compare BF16, FP8
# delayed and MXFP4 at ms/step, so the only thing allowed to differ between
# arms is the quantization recipe — anything else that varies (a second mock
# corpus, a different eval cadence, a launcher that forgets an env switch)
# lands directly in the number being reported.
#
# Everything is read from the environment so the launchers differ only in how
# they set up paths. Required:
#
#   LUMEN_ROOT      Lumen checkout
#   MEGATRON_ROOT   Megatron-LM checkout (needed on PYTHONPATH and for patching)
#   RESULTS_ROOT    writable dir for logs, mock data and the autotune cache
#   TOKENIZER_PATH  HuggingFace tokenizer directory
#
# Optional: MODEL PRECISION NUM_LAYERS TAIL_BF16 MBS GBS SEQ_LEN TRAIN_STEPS
#           SEED NPROC TRAIN_JSONL VALID_JSONL LOG_TAG EVAL_INTERVAL EVAL_ITERS
#           SPLIT DRY_RUN WANDB_PROJECT WANDB_NAME WANDB_ENTITY
#
# DRY_RUN=1 prints the torchrun command and exits without touching a GPU. Use it
# to diff two arms' command lines before spending hours measuring them.

# enable_fp8_for_parallel_linear configured them from the --linear-fp8-scaling
# string ("blockwise") rather than the resolved recipe, so the run silently
# executed FP8 blockwise. With that fixed, the 200-step A/B says the native path
# is worth having: 1429.0 vs 1513.4 ms/step (-5.6%) and 0.6414 vs 0.6556 mem, with
# the loss curve inside the run-to-run noise floor (two identical baselines differ
# by 0.25% mean, the native arm by 0.37%). Numbers from before this date were
# measured on the patched-Megatron path and are 5.6% slower for that reason alone.
#
# The FP8 arm reproduces the recipe the BF16/FP8 reference report measured:
# delayed scaling, amax history 1024, algo max. FP8_FORMAT is overridable because
# `hybrid` is what that report used but it dies in the first backward on this
# stack (mixed-dtype hipb_mm, .claude/tmp-training-bugs.md), so a run here has to
