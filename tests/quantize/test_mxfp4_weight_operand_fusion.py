"""MXFP4 weight operands built directly in the GEMM's layout.

Both operands the weight cache hands out -- the forward's and DGrad's -- are read
by nothing but an MXFP4 GEMM, so the quantizer and the transpose store them in
that GEMM's order and the separate permuting passes go away. A wrong permutation
does not raise: it multiplies the right numbers in the wrong places, so these
compare the GEMM's output against the operands built the two-pass way.
