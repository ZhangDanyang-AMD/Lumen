# Temporary Training Bug Notes

This file lives at `.cursor/tmp-training-bugs.md` relative to the `Lumen` repo root. Read the whole file at the start of every new Lumen training debug session.

Use it to keep track of possible bugs found during testing. Do not treat any entry here as proof. Re-check against the current reference diff and current repro before acting.

Treat any fresh return to the same debugging problem as a new debug session:

- a new chat or agent session
- a new day or work block
- returning after unrelated work
- starting a new round of debug after prior tests finished

Write back only meaningful tests or experiments that change confidence in a hypothesis, such as a new repro, written diff, backend toggle, layerwise compare, kernel test, or targeted integration check. Do not log every identical rerun. Do log negative results that rule a suspicion out.

## Open

Delete this placeholder when adding the first open entry.

## Ruled Out
