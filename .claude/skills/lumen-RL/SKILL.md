# Lumen RL Guide

## Mission

Help choose the right RL framework for Lumen on AMD GPUs and execute the integration in the right order without drifting outside Lumen's current backend constraints.

For the most concrete day-0 startup flow, read [getting-started.md](getting-started.md) first.

## Use When

- Choosing the recommended RL landing path for Lumen on AMD GPUs
- Comparing `TRL` and `VERL`, or explaining why `OpenRLHF` and `DeepSpeedChat` are not first targets
- Estimating the difficulty of direct `DeepSpeed` support for Lumen
- Planning or implementing `lumen/rl/trl/` or `lumen/rl/verl/`
- Reviewing RL roadmap sequencing, scope boundaries, or exit criteria

When code changes are involved, pair this skill with `lumen-coding` and `lumen-test`.

## Current Lumen RL Baseline

Lumen currently has two real training backends:

- `Megatron` via `lumen/models/megatron.py`
- `HF + FSDP/FSDP2` via `lumen/models/fsdp.py`

That implies several hard constraints:

- Lumen already knows how to patch HuggingFace causal LMs with FP8, LoRA, warmup, and checkpoint behavior.
- Lumen already knows how to build Megatron-backed training flows with TP/PP/CP/SP and Lumen-specific communication hooks.
- Lumen does not yet expose a first-class `lumen/rl/` integration layer.
- Lumen does not currently expose a native `DeepSpeed` integration path.
- Several distributed-training efficiency items are still partial or unwired for end-to-end RL, especially `fp8_param_gather`, full TP overlap, and full `delay_wgrad` wiring.

## Default Recommendation

Use this order unless the user gives a strong workload-specific reason to do otherwise:

1. `TRL + Lumen + FSDP/FSDP2`
2. `VERL + Lumen FSDP`
3. `VERL + Lumen Megatron`
4. Optional `DeepSpeed` support only if a real workload forces it

## Decision Rules

### If the user wants the fastest useful RL PoC

- Recommend `TRL`
- Freeze v1 to `GRPO`, HuggingFace rollout, LLaMA-family models, and `FSDP1/FSDP2`
- Read [trl-fsdp-fsdp2-checklist.md](trl-fsdp-fsdp2-checklist.md)

### If the user wants the best long-term architectural fit

- Recommend `VERL`, but do not start with the Megatron stage
- Land `VERL + Lumen FSDP` before `VERL + Lumen Megatron`
- Read [verl-fsdp-megatron-checklist.md](verl-fsdp-megatron-checklist.md)

### If the user asks about `OpenRLHF` or `DeepSpeedChat`

- Explain that both are poor first targets because the training system is `DeepSpeed`-centric
- Treat them as reference architectures, not first implementation targets
- Read [reference.md](reference.md)

### If the user asks about direct `DeepSpeed` support

- Explain the three ambition levels:
  - run Lumen inside ZeRO
  - usable DeepSpeed backend
  - DeepSpeed that preserves Lumen's differentiated distributed value
- Treat `DeepSpeed` as optional work, not a prerequisite for initial RL bring-up
- Read [reference.md](reference.md)

## Execution Workflow

1. Classify the request:
   - framework selection
   - TRL implementation
   - VERL implementation
   - DeepSpeed feasibility
2. Restate the current Lumen backend baseline and scope boundaries.
3. Freeze the first supported algorithm, rollout engine, and model family before proposing implementation work.
4. Use the matching checklist reference rather than inventing a fresh plan.
5. Keep verification gates explicit:
   - 2-GPU smoke
   - no NaN / Inf
   - checkpoint resume works
   - FP8 warmup / reset survives distributed startup

## What To Avoid

- Starting with `OpenRLHF`
- Starting with `DeepSpeedChat`
- Making direct `DeepSpeed` support a prerequisite for initial RL validation
- Bringing up `VERL` FSDP and `VERL` Megatron in the same first patch series
- Adding `vLLM` or `SGLang` before the basic HF rollout path is stable
- Expanding to non-LLaMA models in v1
