"""Pick the fastest MXFP4 GEMM backend per shape, by measuring rather than guessing.

Lumen can reach three AITER MXFP4 GEMM kernels — the plain Triton one, its
shuffled-layout sibling, and the prebuilt A4W4 ASM/CK kernels. Which wins depends
on the shape, and the two fast ones carry a layout prologue that only pays off
once the problem is large enough.

A hand-measured byte threshold does not survive a change of model: the constant
tuned on Llama 3.1 8B (28 MiB MLP weights) excludes Qwen3-8B (24 MiB) entirely.
So the first call for a shape times the legal backends and remembers the winner;
a model issues only a few dozen shapes, so this costs a second once.

Safe because the three backends are bit-for-bit identical — they differ in memory
layout, not arithmetic.

Environment:
    ``LUMEN_MXFP4_AUTOTUNE=0``       fall back to the static byte thresholds
    ``LUMEN_MXFP4_AUTOTUNE_CACHE``   JSON file to persist and reuse decisions
    ``LUMEN_MXFP4_GEMM_SHAPE_LOG``   CSV to record every shape the model issues
