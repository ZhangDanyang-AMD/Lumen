/*
 * Stub for hipThreadExchangeStreamCaptureMode.
 *
 * When CUDA/HIP graph capture is NOT in use (LUMEN_HIP_GRAPHS=0), the
 * per-kernel-launch capture-mode exchange is pure overhead.  LD_PRELOAD
 * this library to replace the ~10,000+ calls per 3 training steps with
 * a trivial no-op.
 *
 * Safety:
 *   - Only use when HIP graph capture is disabled.
 *   - LD_PRELOAD intercepts external callers (PyTorch → HIP) but not
 *     internal calls within libamdhip64.so.
 *   - NCCL/RCCL do not use CUDA graphs, so distributed communication
 *     is unaffected.
 *
 * Build:
 *   gcc -shared -fPIC -o hip_no_stream_capture.so hip_no_stream_capture.c
 *
 * Usage:
 *   LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/hip_no_stream_capture.so python train.py ...
